# tab-cloner-extension
An extension for Chromium-based browsers that clones the current tab and opens it in a new window. Activation via customizable keyboard shortcut (default: Ctrl+Shift+0).

I wanted Ctrl + Enter like in Firefox, but Chromium doesn't allow it.

This extension was created because Chromium doesn't support this like Firefox does. Correct me if I'm wrong.
